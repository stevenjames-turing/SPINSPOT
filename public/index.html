    <h3>About SPINSPOT</h3>
    In an age of information overload, it's getting harder to trust the news. ANY news. A story breaking halfway around the
    world passes through reporters, editors, network executivesk, CEOs and other stakeholders before it ever reaches your
    eyeballs. We may never know the whole truth, but learning to spot the motives behind the way a story is told can help us
    to get closer to it. We're not saying one news outlet is "beter" or "worse" than any other; that's for you to decide.
    SPINSPOT is here for one thing: To show the differences in reporting, empowering readers to make up their own mind about
    the news. We are here for you to SPOT the SPIN in your daily news.
