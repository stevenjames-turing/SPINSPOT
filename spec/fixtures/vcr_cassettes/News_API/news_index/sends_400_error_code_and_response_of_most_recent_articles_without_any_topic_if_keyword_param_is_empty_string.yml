        senior staff writer Cade Metz and Arvind Krishna, IBM CEO and then senior
        vice president and director at IBM Research, speak onstage at the Wired Business
        Conference in New York on June 16, 2016.\n\nIBM shares rose as much as 8%
        on Wednesday after the hardware, software and consulting provider reported
        stronger-than-expected first-quarter results, inspiring analysts to raise
        price targets and estimates.\n\nThe 110-year-old technology company has become
        more favorable to investors this year as central banks have sought to combat
        inflation with higher interest rates. Although it''s not growing as fast as
        many of its enterprise software competitors, it generates income and continues
        to pay dividends, which can serve as a hedge against market uncertainty.\n\nExecutives
        said on Tuesday that it will cost more to add talent in the months to come,
        but the company plans to charge higher prices for consulting engagements.
        It also plans expects to bring out a new mainframe computer, which could help
        growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv now see IBM growing 6% in 2022, up from
        under 4% last year.\n\n\"We''re incrementally more constructive after two
        consecutive Q''s of outperformance,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring,
        who has the equivalent of a buy rating on IBM stock, wrote in a note to clients.
        The firm''s 12-month price target moved to $157 from $150, and it''s expecting
        IBM''s revenue to grow 5% in constant currency in 2022, compared with about
        4% growth earlier.\n\nVolatility and uncertainty are driving market conditions
        at the moment, and now that over half of IBM''s revenue is recurring rather
        than based on one-time transactions, it stands to perform better in the current
        environment than other hardware companies Morgan Stanley is tracking, Woodring
        wrote. That includes Apple, Dell Technologies, HP Inc. and Xerox.\n\nBank
        of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan, with a buy rating on IBM stock, raised
        revenue and earnings expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024. \"With the benefits
        of the Mainframe cycle yet to accrue in 2022/2023, we view the portfolio as
        defensive (outperforms in a difficult macro environment) and expect sustained
        revenue growth beyond 2022,\" they wrote.\n\nCredit Suisse analysts Sami Badri
        and George Engroff, who also rate IBM stock as a buy, pushed up their estimates
        for this year and next year and increased their target price on IBM stock
        by $1 to $166.\n\nNot everyone was feeling better about IBM after the report.
        Toni Sacconaghi Jr. of Bernstein Research, with the equivalent of a hold rating
        on IBM stock, mentioned in a note that while IBM raised its full-year expectations
        \"modestly,\" margins were narrower than expected, and any move higher could
        be temporary, because 2023 will be a more difficult year for the company.\n\nWATCH:
