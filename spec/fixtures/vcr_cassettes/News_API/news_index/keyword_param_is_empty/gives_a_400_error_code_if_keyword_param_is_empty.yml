        officer during a traffic stop earlier this month, has asked civil rights leader
        Rev. Al Sharpton to deliver the eulogy during their son''s funeral Friday.\nThis
        week, Lyoya''s family announced through their attorney, Ben Crump, that the
        funeral will be held at 11 a.m. ET at the Renaissance Church of God in Christ
        in Grand Rapids, Michigan, according to a joint release from Crump and the
        National Action Network (NAN).\nCrump, who has represented the families of
        Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Michael Brown and other high-profile victims
        of police violence, will make a call to action during the funeral services,
        the release said.\nSharpton and NAN have pledged to help Lyoya''s family cover
        his funeral costs, the release says.\nLyoya, 26, moved to the United States
        with his family from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014 and \"tirelessly
        worked to support his family,\" according to the release.\nAn officer from
        the Grand Rapids Police Department fatally shot Lyoya on April 4 after pulling
        him over for an allegedly unregistered license plate. The police department
        released several forms of video footage capturing the approximately two minute
        and 40 second interaction.\nAn autopsy commissioned by Lyoya''s family shows
        he was shot in the back of the head by the Grand Rapids officer, who has not
        been publicly identified. Lyoya wasn''t armed at the time of the shooting,
        according to a family attorney.\nThe Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR)
        has made a request to the Justice Department to launch a \"pattern-or-practice\"
        investigation into the police department following the fatal shooting of Lyoya.\nThe
        footage released by the police department begins with the officer walking
        toward the car, CNN previously reported.\nAccording to the video footage,
        Lyoya turns his back to the officer and appears to walk toward the front of
        the car. The officer puts his hands on Lyoya''s shoulder and back, saying
        \"no, no, no, stop, stop,\" and Lyoya is seen resisting the officer''s touch
        and backing away from the officer.\nThe officer tackles him to the ground.
        Video shows Lyoya getting up and standing, the officer drawing and then deploying
        a Taser, though police say the prongs didn''t hit Lyoya.\nThe two end up physically
        struggling on the ground once more, where the officer shot Lyoya. The officer
        is heard saying \"let go of the Taser\" before firing the fatal shot.\nCNN''s
        Peter Nickeas contributed to this report.","article_title":"Civil rights leader

        Rapids officer, who has not been publicly identified. Lyoya wasn''t armed
        at the time of the shooting, according to a family attorney.</p>\n<p>The Michigan
        Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/us/grand-rapids-police-investigation-patrick-lyoya/index.html\">has
        made a request</a> to the Justice Department to launch a &quot;pattern-or-practice&quot;
        investigation into the police department following the fatal shooting of Lyoya.</p>\n<p>The
        footage released by the police department begins with the officer walking
        toward the car, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/us/michigan-grand-rapids-police-video-patrick-lyoya/index.html\">CNN
        previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the video footage, Lyoya turns
        his back to the officer and appears to walk toward the front of the car. The
        officer puts his hands on Lyoya''s shoulder and back, saying &quot;no, no,
        no, stop, stop,&quot; and Lyoya is seen resisting the officer''s touch and
        backing away from the officer.</p>\n<p>The officer tackles him to the ground.
        Video shows Lyoya getting up and standing, the officer drawing and then deploying
        a Taser, though police say the prongs didn''t hit Lyoya.</p>\n<p>The two end
        up physically struggling on the ground once more, where the officer shot Lyoya.
        The officer is heard saying &quot;let go of the Taser&quot; before firing
        the fatal shot.</p>\n<p>CNN''s Peter Nickeas contributed to this report.</p>","article_abstract":null}'
